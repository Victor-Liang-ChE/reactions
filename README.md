# Concentration vs. Time Graphing
Make Concentration vs. Time graphs for multi-molecular and multi-step reactions
Input the reactions as strings into a matrix, the rate constants into a matrix, and the initial concentration of each species into a dictionary
Example: 
reactions = ['A+B=C', 'B+C=D']
ks = [1, 1.5]
C0 = {'A': 1, 'B': 1, 'C': 0, 'D': 0}
reactiongraphing(reactions, ks, C0)
